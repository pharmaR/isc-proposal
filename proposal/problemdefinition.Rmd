# The Problem
<!-- 
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

R is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry, but rarely within the context of regulatory submissions.  A submission requires the company to collate all relevant statisticical analyses and other supporting evidence to support their claims about their new drug or medical device.  This includes the code required to reproduce the analysis.  Filing for submission is an extremely significant milestone for any company and such quality assurance teams tend to take a risk adverse approach to the submission.  In the context of statistical code, companies need to be extremely confident that the code is behaving as intended.  The question of software validity is often raised when discussing the option of generating submn code through R.  

According to the FDAâ€™s [Glossary of Computer System Software Development Terminology](https://www.fda.gov/iceci/inspections/inspectionguides/ucm074875.htm):

*"**Validation:** Establishing documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a specific process consistently produces a product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes."*

The R Foundation have previously released [R: Regulatory Compliance and Validation Issues. A Guidance Document for the Use of R in Regulated Clinical Trial Environments](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf) which describes the issue of valid and the R Foundation's interpretation of the regulations with respect to base R and the recommend packages.  However, a typical R installation includes hundreds of R packages beyond the base distribution and for the overwhelming majority of packages on CRAN, no such documentation exists to describe the processes followed in developing them.

The industry needs a mechanism by which is can assess the accuracy and consistency of R packages for the inclusion within qualified R installations.  Rather than simply developing and maintaining a large suite of tests the R Validation Hub community feel that a risk-based approach to the adoption of R packages should be sufficient.  This risk-based approach accounts for good practice in package development and the wide exposure of popular R packages to hte R community.  Much of the approach is described over sections of the [R Validation Hub website](https://www.pharmar.org/), although an upcoming white paper (due for release in October 2019) provides a more concise summary of the group's thinking on the subject.

A key component of the proposed risk-based approach is a risk assessment of R packages.  An industry-led and approved tool for package risk assessments will help pave the way for wider adoption of R within regulatory-focused departments (eg Biostatistics) within pharmaceutical companies; thereby opening up R and R packages to thousands of statisticians, programmers and data scientists that may today feel like they are 'not allowed' to use R for submission activities.
